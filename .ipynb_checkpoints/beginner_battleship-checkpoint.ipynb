    "### Lists\n",
    "We saw examples of lists in our Mario Party example from last week.\n",
    "```\n",
    "characters_list = ['Mario', 'Diddy Kong', 'Waluigi', 'Boom Boom']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists are Python objects that let us store things in a convenient location so we can find them later. It's like when you go to a store with a list written down so you can remember what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bananas, OJ, yogurt, Chewbacca onesie pajamas\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice thing about lists is that you are able to add and remove things from them. Adding to a list is also known as 'appending.' \n",
    "```\n",
    "characters_list.append('Luigi')\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you append to a list, the thing you are appending gets added to the last element of the list. Removing something from a list works the same way.\n",
    "```\n",
    "characters_list.remove('Boom Boom')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists also let you find specific elements within them. Suppose we had forgotten which character was second in our list (Remember that Python is 0-indexed, meaning that the first index is 0. So our second character will have an index of 1). We could type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "characters_list[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and we would see that it was Diddy Kong!\n",
    "#### Creating lists\n",
    "We can manually add elements to our list like we did with our character_list but sometimes that takes too long or we don't know exactly what will go into our lists. We are able to fix that problem by using 'for loops' and 'list comprehension.' We will see an example of list comprehension later on but we will skip the details of it for now."

    "```\n",

    "    print(\"Plumber detected\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"How can this be Mario Party without Mario?!?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sometimes we have more than two possible conditions. In these situations, we can use an 'elif' (combining else and if). Let's say that you ask your friend who their favorite Mario Party character is. Your response to them will depend on their favorite character. \n",

    "if friend_favorite == 'Mario':\n",

    "### Functions\n",
    "Sometimes we find ourselves writing the same code over and over again. A good rule of thumb is that if you ever write the same code 3 times or 3more, it's time to write a function.\n",
    "#### What is a function?\n",
    "A function is a chunk of code that runs when you tell it to. It breaks your program into smaller chunks and makes it more organized.\n",
    "#### How do I build a function?\n",
    "When you build a function you must first define it; what will the function be named? This is done by typing `def ` followed by your chosen function name, parentheses, and a colon.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def random_character():\n",
    "```\n",
    "After defining you function, you can put in the chunk of code you want to run each time you call the function.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def random_character():\n",
    "    character_list = ['Mario', 'Luigi', 'Peach', 'Bowser']\n",
    "    random_num = random.randint(0, len(character_list) - 1)\n",
    "    character = character_list[random_num] # Example of list indexing\n",
    "    return character\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we have a function that will give us a random character anytime we call it.\n",
    "#### How do I call a function?\n",
    "A function is called by simply typing the function's name with the associated parentheses. The result of the function (in the above case, character) can also be assigned to a new variable if the result is needed for later.\n",
    "```\n",
    "random_character()\n",
    "# or\n",
    "new_character = random_character()\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### What are function parameters?\n",
    "Function parameters are things that are 'passed into' a function. These parameters are typed in the parentheses when defining and calling a function. Let's say that instead of having the same character_list every time in our random_character function, we want to be able to select from our original list. We will add a parameter to the function so an outside list can be used.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def random_character(char_list):\n",
    "    random_num = random.randint(0, len(char_list) - 1)\n",
    "    character = char_list[random_num]\n",
    "    return character\n",
    "    \n",
    "new_character = random_character(['Mario', 'Diddy Kong', 'Waluigi', 'Boom Boom'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that char_list is just a placeholder in our function. We can pass in any list as a parameter for the function and it will work. We don't need to pass in a variable already named char_list. "
